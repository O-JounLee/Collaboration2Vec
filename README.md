# Collaboration2Vec

### Abstract
<p align="justify">This study aims to validate whether the research performance of scholars correlates with how the scholars work together. Although the most straigthforward approaches are centrality measures of community detection, scholars mostly participate in multiple research groups and have different roles in each group. Thus, we concentrate on the substructures of co-authorship networks rooted in each scholar that cover (i) overlapping of the research groups on the scholar and (ii) roles of the scholar in the groups. This study calls the substructures 'collaboration patterns' and applies subgraph embedding methods to discover and represent the collaboration patterns. Based on embedding the collaboration patterns, we hvae clustered scholars according to their collaboration styles. Then, we have examined whether scholars in each cluster have similar research performance, using the quantitative indicators. The coherence of the indicators cannot be solid proof for validation the correlation between collaboration and performance. Nevertheless, the examination for clusters has exhibited that the collaboration patterns can reflect research styles of scholars. This information will enable us to predict the research performance more accurately since the research styles are more consistent and sustainable features of scholars than a few high-impact publications.
